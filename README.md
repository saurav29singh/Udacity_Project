### Introduction
This project is about setup and to start working with Data Science using Python.
We are writing this blog post as part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program.

The blog is written on the following [link](https://medium.com/@saurav29singh/explore-the-world-of-data-science-using-python-dce102bd036f)


I'm using Olympic Dataset for this project. The dataset describes medals won by athletes in Olympic games.  The original dataset can be found here: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/the-guardian/olympic-games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)

This project focuses on answering following questions:
```
1. Which country has won maximum medals?
2. What was the Gender ratio of athletics during Olympic games?
3. Find out in which year minimum and maximum medal won by athletes?
4. Find out Women participation over the year?
5. In which sports India has won maximum medals?
6. Find out count medals by gender?
7. Find out in which sports women has won maximum gold?
8. In which Year participation of women athlete were less?
9. Is the participation of Men athletes were more than Women?
