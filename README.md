I'm using Summer Olympic Dataset for this project. The dataset describes medals won by athletes in Olympic games.  The orijinal dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/the-guardian/olympic-games

This project focuses on answering following questions: 
1. How to start with Data Science using Python?
2. Which commands need to use to start working with Python?
3. From where we can get Dataset for analysis?
4. How to work on Dataset and to create visualization of Data?
5. How to handle and share code?


I'm using PyCharm IDE with Python3. Here are the python packages:

Numpy
Pandas
Jupyter
Seaborn
matplotlib.pyplot
